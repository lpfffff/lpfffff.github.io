I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Kuang Yaming Honors School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn).

Research Interest
=========
Currently I'm interested in neural network and deep learning. As a junior student, I'm working hard to learn the knowledge and techniques of machine learning.  
I was fortunate to join [Meta Graphics & 3D Version group](http://www.njumeta.com/) for scientific research practice.
